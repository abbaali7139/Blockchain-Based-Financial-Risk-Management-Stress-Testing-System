# Blockchain-Based Financial Risk Management Stress Testing System

A decentralized system for conducting comprehensive financial stress tests using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, immutability, and distributed validation of risk assessments.

## Overview

This system provides a complete framework for financial institutions to conduct stress tests in a transparent and verifiable manner. The blockchain-based approach ensures that all stress test processes, from scenario development to action planning, are recorded immutably and can be audited by regulators and stakeholders.

## System Components

### Core Modules

1. **Coordinator Verification Module**
    - Validates and manages stress test coordinators
    - Ensures only authorized personnel can initiate and oversee stress tests
    - Maintains coordinator credentials and permissions

2. **Scenario Development Module**
    - Creates and manages stress test scenarios
    - Supports multiple scenario types (market crash, liquidity crisis, credit events)
    - Version control for scenario parameters and assumptions

3. **Testing Execution Module**
    - Executes stress tests against financial portfolios
    - Processes multiple scenarios simultaneously
    - Tracks execution status and progress

4. **Result Analysis Module**
    - Analyzes stress test outcomes
    - Calculates risk metrics and impact assessments
    - Generates comprehensive reports

5. **Action Planning Module**
    - Develops remediation plans based on test results
    - Tracks implementation of risk mitigation measures
    - Monitors effectiveness of implemented actions

## Key Features

- **Transparency**: All stress test activities are recorded on the blockchain
- **Immutability**: Test results and scenarios cannot be altered after execution
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- **Decentralized Validation**: Multiple parties can verify test integrity
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live tracking of stress test execution and results

## Technical Architecture

The system is built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, providing:

- Type safety and predictable execution
- Built-in security features
- Integration with Bitcoin's security model
- Efficient resource management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain node
- Clarity development environment
- Node.js for testing framework

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: \`npm install\`
3. Run tests: \`npm test\`
4. Deploy to testnet: \`npm run deploy:testnet\`

### Usage

1. **Register as Coordinator**: Submit credentials for verification
2. **Develop Scenarios**: Create stress test scenarios with parameters
3. **Execute Tests**: Run stress tests against target portfolios
4. **Analyze Results**: Review outcomes and risk assessments
5. **Plan Actions**: Develop and implement mitigation strategies

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive test suites using Vitest:

- Unit tests for individual modules
- Integration tests for cross-module functionality
- Scenario-based testing for various stress conditions
- Performance tests for large-scale executions

## Compliance

This system is designed to meet regulatory requirements including:

- Basel III stress testing guidelines
- CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review)
- ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process)
- Local regulatory frameworks

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Role-based access control
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Regular security audits and updates
